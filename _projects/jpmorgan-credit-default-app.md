# JP Morgan Credit Default Predictor

This project was developed as a spin-off of the [**JP Morgan Chase & Co. Quantitative Research Virtual Internship**](https://www.theforage.com/simulations/jpmorgan/quantitative-research-11oc).  
The goal was to build a reliable model that predicts the probability of a customer defaulting on a credit payment ‚Äî a key task in minimizing financial risk and improving lending decisions.  

The work combines two parts:
- **Analysis & Model Selection:** a full Jupyter Notebook workflow, including EDA, feature engineering, handling class imbalance, and hyperparameter tuning. I compared a classic **XGBoost** model with a **Deep Learning** approach (TensorFlow/Keras) to identify the best performer.  
- **Deployment as a Web App:** the chosen model was integrated into a production-style **FastAPI** application, containerized with **Docker**, and deployed to **Render** for real-time credit risk prediction.
