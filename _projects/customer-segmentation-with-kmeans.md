## Unlocking Business Insights with Customer Segmentation

To move beyond a "one-size-fits-all" marketing strategy, this project segmented a customer base into distinct groups based on their purchasing behavior. The goal was to provide actionable insights for **targeted ad campaigns, personalized promotions, and customer retention strategies**.

The analysis used **unsupervised machine learning** with **K-Means clustering**. The **Elbow and Silhouette methods** guided the choice of the optimal number of segments. To handle high-dimensional data and enable clear visualization, I applied dimensionality reduction with **PCA and t-SNE**.

The final model identified **five distinct customer personas**, including:  
- **Core loyal customers**  
- **Potential churn risks**  
- **High-value spenders**  
- Plus two additional groups with unique purchasing patterns
