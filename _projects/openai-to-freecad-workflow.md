## The Vision: Democratizing 3D Design

Complex CAD (technical drawing) software often presents a steep learning curve, creating a barrier between a designer's idea and a digital model. This project explores a new frontier in **language-to-geometry interfaces**, building an automated pipeline that transforms natural language instructions into editable 3D models with fully defined parameters.

## How It Works: A Prompt-Driven Modeling Pipeline

1. **Instruction Input** â€” the user provides verbal instructions for a 3D part.  
2. **LLM Interpretation** â€” an LLM (via OpenAI API) translates these into executable Python code.  
3. **Code Execution** â€” the script runs in FreeCAD to automatically construct a parametric CAD model.

## Key Features & Innovations

- **Automated Pipeline** â€” end-to-end workflow from text input to CAD model, orchestrated with **LangChain**.  
- **AI-Powered Error Correction** â€” a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** component detects and fixes common CAD code errors (e.g., misapplied rotations, bad feature constraints).  
- **Parametric by Design** â€” outputs are true **parametric CAD models**, not static meshes, making them editable and reusable for design iteration.
