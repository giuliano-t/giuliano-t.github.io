## Discovering Hidden Couplings in Aero-Engines

Next-generation aero-engines rely on shorter, stiffer shafts carrying longer, more flexible blades.  
These designs improve efficiency and reduce noise — but they also create **hidden vibration risks**.  

During my PhD at **Imperial College London (Rolls-Royce UTC)**, I uncovered and validated entirely new families of coupled vibration modes that challenge the long-standing assumption that shaft, disc, and blade dynamics can be treated independently.  

Using advanced finite element modelling, I predicted the existence of *mixed modes* — where asymmetric bearing supports merge axial and lateral shaft vibrations. These modes, in turn, simultaneously excite disc umbrella (0ND) and blade (1ND) patterns. I then extended the analysis to flexible bladed discs with stagger angles, showing that axial, lateral, and torsional dynamics can combine into unique “fully coupled” behaviours.  

Finally, I designed and commissioned the **ARES test facility** to deliberately trigger these phenomena. Experiments confirmed the predictions and even revealed additional unexpected couplings in mistuned systems.  

**Impact:** this body of work demonstrated that classical uncoupled assumptions in rotor dynamics are no longer valid for future architectures. For the safe and reliable design of ultra-efficient engines, engineers must now account for these coupled behaviours in both modelling and testing.
