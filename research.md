# Research

During my PhD in **Structural Dynamics** at **Imperial College London**, I investigated vibration coupling in aero-engine rotor systems, combining advanced modelling, test rig design, and experimental validation.  
My work has been published in journals, book chapters, and international conference proceedings.
