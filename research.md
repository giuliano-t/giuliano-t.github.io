## Discovering Hidden Couplings in Aero-Engines

My PhD at **Imperial College London (Rolls-Royce UTC)** uncovered hidden vibration interactions in aero-engine rotors — phenomena that had never been recognised before.  
By combining advanced modelling with a custom-built test rig, I proved that traditional uncoupled assumptions are no longer valid.  
This research now informs how future engines must be designed for both efficiency and reliability.

## Research Summary

Next-generation aero-engines rely on shorter, stiffer shafts carrying longer, more flexible blades.  
These designs improve efficiency and reduce noise — but they also create **hidden vibration risks**.  

These designs improve efficiency and reduce noise — but they also create hidden vibration risks. This raised a key question: could vibrations in different parts of the rotor, once thought independent, actually interact in unexpected ways?

In my research I uncovered and validated entirely new families of coupled vibration modes. Using advanced finite element models, I showed that asymmetric bearing supports can cause shaft bending and axial motions to merge into new “hybrid” modes — for example, a bending pattern and an axial compression mode blending into one. Extending the analysis to bladed discs showed that torsional, lateral, and axial vibrations can also combine into unique, fully coupled behaviours.

Finally, I designed and commissioned the **ARES test facility** to deliberately trigger these phenomena. Experiments confirmed the predictions and even revealed additional unexpected couplings in mistuned systems.  

**Impact:** my research demonstrated that classical uncoupled assumptions in rotor dynamics are no longer valid for future architectures. For the safe and reliable design of ultra-efficient engines, engineers must now account for these coupled behaviours in both modelling and testing.
