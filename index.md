# About Me

Engineer-turned-ML practitioner with a PhD in **Structural Dynamics** from **Imperial College London** and experience in **high-integrity aerospace systems** (Rolls-Royce, Airbus).  
I recently completed a **Data Science & AI career accelerator** at the **University of Cambridge**, focusing on **Deep Learning, LLMs, and agentic architectures**.  

I bring a disciplined, analytical mindset, clear communication skills, and a practical engineering approach to machine learning â€” focused on building **reliable, innovative AI solutions for complex real-world challenges**.

## What Iâ€™m passionate about

- Exploring the intersection of **engineering and AI**, creating generative workflows such as my natural-language-to-3D CAD pipeline.  
- Leveraging **Large Language Models (LLMs)** for advanced applications, including retrieval-augmented Q&A and multi-agent supervision (e.g. Bank of England).  
- Delivering **end-to-end ML solutions**, from training classifiers like XGBoost to deploying them with FastAPI and Docker.
