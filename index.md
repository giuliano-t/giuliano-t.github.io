# About Me

Hi, I‚Äôm **Giuliano Tuzzi** ‚Äî an aerospace engineer-turned-data scientist with a PhD in **Structural Dynamics** from **Imperial College London**.

I bring **3.5 years of industry experience** from leading firms like **Rolls-Royce** and **Airbus**, and I‚Äôm now focused on applying **Machine Learning and AI** to tackle real-world problems. I recently completed a Data Science & AI career accelerator at the **University of Cambridge**, where I focused on **Deep Learning** and **LLMs**.

What I‚Äôm passionate about:
- Exploring the intersection of **engineering and AI**, creating generative workflows like my natural language-to-3D CAD model pipeline.
- Leveraging **Large Language Models (LLMs)** for advanced applications, including building RAG pipelines and multi-agent frameworks for clients like the **Bank of England**.
- Building **End-To-End ML solutions**, from training advanced classifiers like XGBoost to deploying them with tools like FastAPI and Docker.
