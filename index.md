# About Me

Engineer-turned-ML practitioner with a PhD in **Structural Dynamics** from **Imperial College London** and experience in **high-integrity aerospace systems** (Rolls-Royce, Airbus).  
I recently completed a **Data Science & AI career accelerator** at the **University of Cambridge**, focusing on **Deep Learning, LLMs, and agentic architectures**.  

I bring a disciplined, analytical mindset, clear communication skills, and a practical engineering approach to machine learning — focused on building **reliable, innovative AI solutions for complex real-world challenges**.

## What I’m passionate about

- Exploring the intersection of **engineering and AI**, creating generative workflows such as my natural-language-to-3D CAD pipeline.  
- Leveraging **Large Language Models (LLMs)** for advanced applications, including retrieval-augmented Q&A and multi-agent supervision (e.g. Bank of England).  
- Delivering **end-to-end ML solutions**, from training classifiers like XGBoost to deploying them with FastAPI and Docker.

## Education & Work Experience
- 🎓 **PhD, Structural Dynamics** – Imperial College London  
- ✈️ **Aerospace Engineering Roles** – Rolls-Royce (Stress Engineer), Airbus (Loads & Aeroelastics)  
- 📊 **Data Science & AI Accelerator** – University of Cambridge

Alongside my transition into Data Science and AI, I also maintain a deep research track in structural dynamics and complex vibration interactions — developed during my PhD at Imperial College London and published in leading journals. If your work touches rotor dynamics, aeroelasticity, or vibration analysis, you can dive into my research [here](/research).
