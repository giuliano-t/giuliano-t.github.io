# About Me

I am an engineer and Data Science/Machine Learning practitioner with a PhD in **Structural Dynamics** from **Imperial College London** and extensive experience in the **aerospace industry** (Rolls-Royce, Airbus).  
I recently completed a **Data Science with Machine Learning & AI career accelerator** at the **University of Cambridge**, focusing on **Deep Learning, LLMs, and agentic architectures**.  

I bring a strong analytical and research-oriented mindset, excellent communication skills, and a thorough approach to Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence solutions. One of my main interests is the application of Generative AI and agentic architectures to **complex real-world challenges**.

## What I‚Äôm passionate about

- Exploring the intersection of **engineering and AI**, creating generative workflows such as my natural-language-to-3D CAD pipeline. I'm currently extending this toward a full FEA workflow.  
- Leveraging **Large Language Models (LLMs)** for advanced applications, including retrieval-augmented automated debugging and multi-agent orchestration (e.g. Bank of England project).  
- Delivering **end-to-end ML solutions**, from training classifiers like XGBoost and Neural Networks to deploying them with FastAPI and Docker.

## Education & Work Experience
- üî¨ **PhD, Structural Dynamics** ‚Äì Imperial College London (sponsored by Rolls-Royce Civil)  
- ‚öôÔ∏è **Stress Engineer, Rolls-Royce Defence** ‚Äì focused on low-pressure turbine blade vibration and HCF analysis for a technical demonstrator  
- ‚úàÔ∏è **Loads & Aeroelastics Engineer, Airbus UK** ‚Äì responsible for whole-aircraft gust loads across multiple programs and ground loads calculations  
- üìä **Data Science & AI Accelerator** ‚Äì University of Cambridge  


Alongside my transition into Data Science and AI, I also maintain a deep research track in structural dynamics and complex vibration interactions. For those interested in rotor dynamics, aeroelasticity, or vibration analysis, you can explore my research [here](/research).
